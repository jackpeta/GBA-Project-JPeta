Minesweeper
GBA port by Jack Peta

How the game works:
- The purpose of the game is to flag all of the "mine" tiles on the board.
- The numbers on the tiles determine how many mines are adjacent to that tile, including diagonals.
- When your cursor is hovered over a mine, you can either break the tile or place a flag on it (indicating it contains a mine)
- If you break a tile that is a mine, you lose.
- If you successfully navigate the board by breaking non-mine tiles and flag every mine tile, you win.

How to play:
- Click enter to start the game from the welcome screen
- Press enter again to break the tiles and start the game.
- Use the arrow keys to go in each of the cardinal directions. Your current position is indicated by the white cursor.
- Press A (x) to break a tile, and B (z) to flag a tile.
- Click backspace to restart the game at any time
